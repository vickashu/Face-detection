# Real-Time Face Detection with OpenCV

## Overview
This C++ project utilizes OpenCV to perform real-time face detection using a webcam. The application identifies faces in each video frame, draws rectangles around them, and provides dynamic feedback on the number of faces detected.


## Features
- **Real-Time Processing:** Continuous face detection in live video feed from the webcam.
- **Visual Feedback:** Rectangles drawn around detected faces, with a dynamic overlay indicating the number of faces found.
- **OpenCV:** Leveraging the Open Source Computer Vision Library for efficient image processing.

## Dependencies
- C++ Compiler
- OpenCV Library
